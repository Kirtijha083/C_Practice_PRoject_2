# Simple Calculator in C

# Project Overview
A basic calculator implemented in C programming language that performs arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power functions.

# Features
1. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, and Power operations
2. Error handling for division and modulus by NAN
3. Clean and interactive console-based interface

## How It Works
1. Display a menu with options for each operation.
2. Takes two inputs from the user.
3. Performs the selected operation using functions.
4. Shows the result or an error message if invalid.

## Functions Used
1. **division(double, double):** Handles division with error handling
2. **modulus(int, int):** Handles modulus with error handling
3. **print_menu():** Displays the operation menu

## Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler
- Basic understanding of C language

## Example Output
```
Welcome to Simple Calculator!
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
6. Power
7. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Result of operation is: 8.00
```
